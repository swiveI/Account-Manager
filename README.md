# Account-Manager
Account manager is a tool for converting spreadsheet data, via csv, into arrays for easy access by udonbehavours within VRChat.

This tool was origionally built for the Loli Police Department roleplay group in VRChat. No affiliation with any actual law enforcement agency. discord.gg/lpd

This tool designed to handle tracking player data via spreadsheets and bringing that data into VRChat. 
It is intended to be used by programmers to build other Udon scripts that work off of this data.
A common usage for example would be to track patreon supporters to grant access to perks within the world, 
or by adding them to a custom list you can easilly update name displays within the world.
